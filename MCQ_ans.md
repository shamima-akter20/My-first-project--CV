### 3. Ans:  

-   A: ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔']
```bash
Here food with four elements and an object info with a favoriteFood  is declared .
I reassign info.favoriteFood to "🍝". However, this reassignment does not affect the food array in any way. So, when I log the food array, it will still contain its original elements, resulting in ['🍕', '🍫', '🥑', '🍔'].  


```
